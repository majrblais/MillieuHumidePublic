# causalML

Welcome to the causalML folder. This folder contains resources and code related to causal machine learning methodologies.

## Contents

### training.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook file is used to train causalML algorithms for all ecosystem functions. It includes cells for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
It consists of using multiple algorithms on a data filling method to get the importance of certain features.
### results
This folder contains the feature importance graphs and tables for each ecosystem function derived from the causalML analyses. The results are organized in `.tex` format for easy integration into reports.

## Usage
1. **training.ipynb**: To train the causalML algorithms, open and run the `training.ipynb` notebook.
2. The results files are automatically generated.
