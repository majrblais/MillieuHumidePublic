# Classification

This directory contains code and resources for classification, organized based on the features utilized by the algorithms.

## Subfolders

### All_features
Contains code for training classification models using all available features, as well as methods for feature selection and ensemble learning.
More information can be found [here](./All_features)

- **Training_norm/Training_non_norm**: Scripts and notebooks for training models, feature selection, and ensemble learning.
- **TrainingResults**: Contains the results from Training_norm and Training_non_norm.
- **EnsembleLearning**: Scripts for performing ensemble learning on the best models.
- **FeatureSelection**: Scripts for applying feature reduction algorithms.

- **Dimension_Reduction(Discontinued)**: Scripts for Dimesnion Reduction (disc)

### Specific_features
This subfolder is designated for classification algorithms trained on specific features focusing on particular ecosystem functions derived from the WESP-AC.
More information can be found [here](./Specific_features)
- **Training_norm/Training_non_norm**: Scripts and notebooks for training models, feature selection, and ensemble learning.
- **TrainingResults**: Contains the results from Training_norm and Training_non_norm.
- **EnsembleLearning**: Scripts for performing ensemble learning on the best models.
- **FeatureSelection**: Scripts for applying feature reduction algorithms.

## Usage
Refer to the respective subfolder READMEs for detailed instructions on running the code and reproducing results.

## Future Work
- Adding code for training on specific features in the `Specific_features` subfolder.
- Expanding feature selection methods and ensemble learning techniques.
- Developing new models and methods for the `Xtra_features` and `Specific_Xtra_features` subfolders.
