# FeatureSelection

This directory contains scripts and resources for applying feature reduction algorithms to the trained classification models. The goal is to reduce the number of features while maintaining similar performance scores, thereby easing the process of analyzing functions for wetlands.

## Overview

The feature selection process uses results and saved information from the `Training_Code/Results` folder. Three feature reduction algorithms are applied to identify the optimal subset of features for each ecosystem function.

## Contents

### Scripts

1. **feat_selection_all.ipynb**
    - **Purpose**: Applies feature reduction to each best model for each data file of a specified ecosystem function.
    - **Inputs**: 
        - `best_model_infoXXX.csv` file for the specified ecosystem function.
        - Saved weights from `../training/results/XXX`.
    - **Outputs**: 
        - Graphs showing feature reduction results for each data file.
    - **Description**: For each best model, feature reduction is performed using three algorithms. The number of features is varied from 2 to the maximum available. Results are saved as graphs.

2. **feat_selection_best.ipynb**
    - **Purpose**: Processes each ecosystem function, focusing only on the best model for each function.
    - **Inputs**:
        - Best model data for each ecosystem function.
    - **Outputs**:
        - Graphs showing the best results for each feature reduction technique.
        - CSV files named `test_results_XXX.csv` for each ecosystem function.
    - **Description**: Preferred over `feat_selection_all.ipynb`, this script provides a comprehensive analysis by printing the highest accuracy and the proportionate highest accuracy (relative to the lowest number of features). CSV files contain detailed results for each feature reduction technique, including accuracy and selected features for each feature count.

3. **best_models_ensemble_learning.ipynb**
    - **Purpose**: Creates confusion matrices for the top results and ensemble learning models.
    - **Inputs**:
        - CSV files generated by `feat_selection_best.ipynb` for each ecosystem function.
    - **Outputs**:
        - Confusion matrices for the top 2 results based on best accuracy for each ecosystem function.
        - Confusion matrices for an ensemble learning model using the best 5 models for each function.
    - **Description**: This script provides visualizations to compare the performance of top individual models and an ensemble model.

### Folder

- **results**
    - **Purpose**: Stores the results generated by the feature selection scripts.
    - **Contents**: Graphs, CSV files, and other output data from the feature reduction processes.

## Usage

### feat_selection_all.ipynb
1. Specify the ecosystem function to be processed.
2. Ensure the `best_model_infoXXX.csv` file and saved weights are available in the `../training/results/XXX` directory.
3. Run the script to generate graphs showing feature reduction results for each data file.

### feat_selection_best.ipynb
1. Ensure best model data is available for each ecosystem function.
2. Run the script to process each function and generate the comprehensive results, including accuracy and selected features.
3. Review the generated graphs and `test_results_XXX.csv` files for detailed results.

### best_models_ensemble_learning.ipynb
1. Ensure the CSV files from `feat_selection_best.ipynb` are available.
2. Run the script to generate confusion matrices for the top results and ensemble models.
3. Analyze the confusion matrices to compare individual model performance and ensemble model performance.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing additional feature reduction techniques.
- Improving visualization methods for better analysis.
- Extending ensemble learning approaches to include more diverse model combinations.
